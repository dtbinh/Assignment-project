This HW is based on the assumption that only one variable x is used and all the premises having the variable x unify to just one value. Also, since the TA responded on the discussion board, for the thread "Unification at different levels and different values" that it will not be included, the following test case is not handled.
A(A,B)
3
B(x,ABC)&C(x,CDE)=>A(A,B)
D(x,ABC)=>B(DEF,ABC)
D(DE,ABC)
C(DEF,CDE)

Also, since the specfication of algo is not clear with respect to the requirements of the HW, the clause B(x,ABC)&C(x,CDE)=>A(A,B) having variable x can take different values for 1st premise than that of 2nd premise.
